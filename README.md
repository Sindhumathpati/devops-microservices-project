‚úÖ Stage 1: Infrastructure Provisioning
Goal: Provision a secure, scalable Kubernetes environment.

What I did:

Used Terraform to define all infrastructure as code.

Provisioned Kubernetes cluster (EKS/GKE for cloud; Minikube for demo/testing).

Defined networking resources: VPC, subnets, security groups.

Managed IAM roles and permissions.

Configured a remote backend (S3 + DynamoDB) to store Terraform state safely.

‚úÖ Stage 2: Application Development & Containerization
Goal: Develop microservices and package them in containers.

What I did:

Developed 3 microservices:

user-service: user CRUD API

product-service: product CRUD API

frontend: React/Angular web app

Added unit tests for each service.

Created a Dockerfile for each service.

Built images locally and pushed them to Docker Hub.

Wrote Kubernetes manifests / Helm charts for each microservice.

‚úÖ Stage 3: Continuous Integration Pipeline
Goal: Automate build, test, and deployment tasks.

What I did:

Set up GitHub Actions (or Jenkins) for CI:

Lint: Check code quality.

Test: Run unit tests automatically on pull requests.

Build: Build Docker images for each microservice.

Push: Push images to Docker Hub with version tags.

Protected main branch with checks to enforce clean code.

‚úÖ Stage 4: GitOps Continuous Deployment
Goal: Automate Kubernetes deployment using GitOps best practices.

What I did:

Installed ArgoCD on the Kubernetes cluster using Helm.

Created a separate gitops-infra repo to hold Kubernetes manifests.

Configured ArgoCD to auto-sync resources from the Git repo.

Enabled automatic self-healing so the cluster state matches Git.

Demonstrated declarative, version-controlled cluster management.

‚úÖ Stage 5: Monitoring & Logging
Goal: Ensure cluster observability and easy debugging.

What I did:

Deployed Prometheus & Grafana using Helm:

Collected metrics: CPU, memory, request latency, error rate.

Built dashboards for real-time visibility.

Configured alerts for critical resource usage.

Deployed Loki (or Fluent Bit + ELK) to centralize logs:

Collected logs from all microservices.

Made debugging and tracing across pods easy.

üì¶ Docker Hub
All images are hosted on my public Docker Hub account:
https://hub.docker.com/u/sindhumathapati7

‚öôÔ∏è Run the Project in 5 Stages
üîπ Stage 1: Provision Infrastructure with Terraform

Navigate to your Terraform folder:

bash
cd terraform

Initialize Terraform:

bash
terraform init

Review your plan:

bash
terraform plan
Apply your configuration to provision the cluster and networking:

bash
terraform apply
‚úÖ After this step, your Kubernetes cluster and networking will be ready.

üîπ Stage 2: Build & Push Docker Images
Build Docker images for each microservice:

bash
docker build -t user-service ./backend/user-service
docker build -t product-service ./backend/product-service
docker build -t frontend ./frontend

Login to Docker Hub:

bash
docker login

Tag and push the images to your Docker Hub repo:

bash
docker tag user-service sindhumathpati/user-service:latest
docker tag product-service sindhumathpati/product-service:latest
docker tag frontend sindhumathpati/frontend:latest

docker push sindhumathpati/user-service:latest
docker push sindhumathpati/product-service:latest
docker push sindhumathpati/frontend:latest
‚úÖ Use these image URLs in your K8s manifests or Helm charts.

üîπ Stage 3: Deploy ArgoCD for GitOps
Add the ArgoCD Helm repo:

bash
helm repo add argo https://argoproj.github.io/argo-helm
helm repo update

Install ArgoCD in your cluster:

bash
kubectl create namespace argocd
helm install argocd argo/argo-cd -n argocd

Port-forward the ArgoCD UI:

bash
kubectl port-forward svc/argocd-server -n argocd 8080:443
Login to ArgoCD UI at https://localhost:8080 and connect it to your gitops-infra repo.

‚úÖ ArgoCD will now sync your manifests to the cluster automatically.

üîπ Stage 4: Run CI Pipeline
Make a code change or push to main.

The GitHub Actions workflow will:

Lint and test your code

Build Docker images

Push updated images to Docker Hub

ArgoCD will pick up updated manifests and deploy the changes

‚úÖ This creates an end-to-end automated flow from code ‚Üí build ‚Üí deploy.

üîπ Stage 5: Verify, Monitor & Access
Check pods and services:

bash
kubectl get pods
kubectl get svc

Get the LoadBalancer IP or Ingress URL to access your app.

Access monitoring tools:

Prometheus: http://<prometheus-ip>:9090

Grafana: http://<grafana-ip>:3000 (default credentials: admin/admin)

View centralized logs in Loki or your chosen log stack.

‚úÖ You now have a fully running, monitored microservices app on Kubernetes!
